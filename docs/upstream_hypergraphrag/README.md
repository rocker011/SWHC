##  Overview 

![](./figs/F1.png)

## Environment Setup
```bash
conda create -n hypergraphrag python=3.11
conda activate hypergraphrag
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `api_config.txt` in the repository root before running:

```text
your_openai_api_key
https://your-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1
gpt-4o-mini
text-embedding-3-small
```

## Quick Start
### Knowledge HyperGraph Construction
```python
import json
from hypergraphrag import HyperGraphRAG

rag = HyperGraphRAG(working_dir=f"expr/example")

with open(f"example_contexts.json", mode="r") as f:
    unique_contexts = json.load(f)
    
rag.insert(unique_contexts)
```

### Knowledge HyperGraph Query
```python
from hypergraphrag import HyperGraphRAG

rag = HyperGraphRAG(working_dir=f"expr/example")

query_text = 'How strong is the evidence supporting a systolic BP target of 120–129 mmHg in elderly or frail patients, considering potential risks like orthostatic hypotension, the balance between cardiovascular benefits and adverse effects, and the feasibility of implementation in diverse healthcare settings?'

result = rag.query(query_text)
print(result)
```

## Repository Layout

- `hypergraphrag/`: core baseline package plus method extensions such as `swhc.py`
- `evaluation/`: experiment workspace, method runners, scoring scripts, and dual realtime/batch backends
- `docs/`: project documentation, reports, and figures
- `REPO_STRUCTURE.md`: repository organization notes
- `evaluation/STRUCTURE.md`: experiment directory convention for datasets, methods, results, and future baselines
